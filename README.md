# This is elliptical to circle arcs converter

### While working on one of the projects, it became necessary to solve the problem of converting elliptical arcs into circular ones.  In my tasks, the deviation parameter was set to no more than 0.05 mm. 

### And although this problem is quite common (a number of machines cut straight or in a circular arc ) no ready-made open source solution was found, or the proposed options gave too large an error.

### You can enter parameters for the radius and the number of segments and then get an updated path for the svg. 

### A dot on the screen shows the location of the maximum deviation from the elliptical trajectory. 

### The maxDeviation value is the size of the deviation.

### Also zoom and drug picture.
